# principal-components-analysis

## Author: Philip Amwata

### Project Description

C++ implementation of K-means clustering algorithm with
a Euclidean distance metric. The implemented K-means algorithm
will cluster 8 examples into 3 clusters using sample
1, 4 and 7 as the initial centroid for each cluster and 
output the results to a text file.

### Project Structure

**bin**: The output executables, both for the app and for any tests.

**build**: This folder contains all object files, and is removed on a clean.

**include**: All project header files. All necessary third-party header files that do not exist under /usr/local/include.

**src**: The applicationâ€™s source files.

**test**: All test code files.

### Makefile Instructions

**make**: compile and link

**make run**: run program

**make clean**: delete all object files

### NOTES

**Results for the Principal Component Analysis will be output to the console but a text file can also be found in the bin/ directory**
